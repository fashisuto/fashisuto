# Profile - üßç

:wave: Hi! I'm Peter "fashisuto" Johnson, and I do software development. I'm extremely interested in compilers, kernels, and generally difficult programming tasks. I'm a huge fan of Mathematics in general, and I enjoy writing math related software.

## Interests

I'm interested in Calculus, Algebra, Game Theory, Compiler Theory, and Computer Science. I love ML & DL, and I am always keeping up with what is happening in the CS field in general.

## Currently Learning

I'm currently learning how to write a compiler, what *good* syntax is, and how to make my language "sexy", along with some other CS subjects like [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) or [Network topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology). And I will say, it's extremely interesting.

# Projects - üî¨

## `niichan` - My hobby compiler suite

### Status ‚è≤Ô∏è

```toml
[niichan]
public = false
branch = "next"
beta = true
version = 0.2
```

### Description

`niichan` is a toolchain for my programming language `nii`, which is an LLVM-like language with more features and riddance of the SSA. It compiles quickly and efficiently, without imposing useless semantics. For abstraction purposes, the language does abstract some semantics, but not enough to be a hinderance. I'm planning on using it as an IR for my next programming language or maybe a simple compiler for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Collaboration

Feel free to collaborate and contribute to any of my public repositories.
